### Issue: [**Web3 Feature / Bug Report**]

**Description:**  
[Provide a detailed explanation of the issue or feature request related to your Web3 final year project. Include context about smart contract interactions, wallet connections, or dApp UI/UX.]

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. [Step 1 - Launch the Web3 dApp in browser or mobile]
2. [Step 2 - Connect wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect)]
3. [Step 3 - Interact with feature (e.g., send transaction, view assets)]
4. [Step 4 - Observe unexpected behavior or bug]

**Expected Behavior:**  
- [Describe the correct behavior, e.g., transaction should succeed, assets should display, UI should update smoothly, etc.]

**Actual Behavior:**  
- [Describe what actually happens, e.g., transaction fails, assets do not display, error messages, UI glitches, etc.]

**Reference:**  
- Relevant file/component: [e.g., WalletConnectButton.tsx, SmartContract.sol, TransactionList.tsx]
- Screenshots, videos, or logs (attach links or files)

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Wallet connection works reliably and displays correct user address
- [ ] Smart contract interactions (read/write) succeed without errors
- [ ] UI updates smoothly after blockchain events (no flicker, no stale data)
- [ ] Error messages are clear and only shown when appropriate
- [ ] Loading indicators are shown during async operations (e.g., transaction pending)
- [ ] Data is only displayed after successful fetch from blockchain or backend

**Engineer's Confirmation Checklist**
- [ ] Verified fix in local/dev environment
- [ ] Pushed changes to personal branch and labeled appropriately
- [ ] Marked issue as `ready for push` & `waiting to test (in localhost)`
- [ ] Notified QA/test lead (@testlead) when ready for review
- [ ] Used commit message format: fix(#issueNumber) or feat(#issueNumber) when pushing updates

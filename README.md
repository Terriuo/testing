## 📝 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a decentralized web3 application. The main objectives include exploring blockchain technologies, smart contracts, and modern web development frameworks to solve a real-world problem in a trustless, decentralized manner.

*You can add more specific details about your project's purpose and use case here.*

## ✨ Features

- User authentication via crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
- Smart contract deployment and interaction
- Decentralized data storage (e.g., IPFS)
- [Feature X]
- [Feature Y]
- Responsive and intuitive UI

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [React.js / Next.js / Vue.js]
- **Backend:** [Node.js / Express.js / None]
- **Smart Contracts:** [Solidity] on [Ethereum / Polygon / BSC]
- **Wallet Integration:** [MetaMask / WalletConnect]
- **Other:** [IPFS, The Graph, Chainlink, ...]
- **Testing:** [Jest / Hardhat / Truffle]

*Replace the above with your actual tools and frameworks.*

## 🚀 Getting Started
`
### Prerequisites

- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or compatible crypto wallet
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) / [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (for smart contract development)

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OneCrispyDuck/web3-final-year-project.git
cd web3-final-year-project
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the App

```sh
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

### Deploying Smart Contracts

```sh
# Example with Hardhat
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network]
```
